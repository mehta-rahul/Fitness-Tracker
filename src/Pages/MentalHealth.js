          <p>Exercise is widely known for its physical benefits, but its positive impact on mental health is equally significant. 
            Regular physical activity can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression while improving mood and overall well-being. 
            Hereâ€™s a closer look at how exercise can boost your mental health and some tips to get started.

            <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl py-2'>1. Reduces Stress</h2>
            <p>Exercise helps reduce stress by increasing the production of endorphins, the body's natural mood elevators. 
              It also helps to lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. 
               in physical activity can provide a mental break from daily pressures and improve your ability to cope with stress.

            <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl py-2'>2. Alleviates Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Regular exercise can help reduce symptoms of anxiety. Physical activity increases sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine, which help alleviate feelings of anxiety. 
              Exercise also promotes the release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that has a calming effect on the brain.

            <h2 className='font-bold text-2xl py-2'>5. Improves Sleep</h2>
            <p>Exercise can help regulate sleep patterns and improve the quality of your sleep. Physical activity increases the time spent in deep sleep, which is crucial for body and mind recovery.

            <p>Exercise can enhance cognitive function and protect against cognitive decline as we age. Physical activity increases the production of neurotrophic factors, which support the growth and survival of neurons. 
              This can lead to improved memory, concentration, and overall brain health.
